## Overview
**LICA (Low-cost Interactive Cognitive Agent)** The robot’s internal system consists of modular electronics, including a microcontroller, motor drivers, and simple wiring connections that are intentionally exposed to emphasize transparency and educational value. Flexible cables and string-based actuation systems help drive the upper expressive elements (ears), enabling lifelike motion with minimal mechanical complexity. Similar to Blossom, LICA adopts natural materials like wood to create a more approachable and emotionally comfortable interaction, especially for children with autism.

## Florida Session — LICA as a Learning Companion for Children with Autism

Earlier this year, LICA was deployed in a hands-on educational session in Florida, where children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) participated in a *robot customization workshop* designed to encourage creativity, social engagement, and emotional expression.

Children were invited to personalize their own LICA robot using craft materials — adding eyes, ears, hats, accessories, and fabric decorations — transforming each robot into a unique companion. This participatory design approach helped lower interaction barriers and fostered a sense of ownership and emotional connection with the robot.

### What We Observed

- *Increased engagement*: Children remained focused and enthusiastic throughout the session, interacting with both the robot and peers.
- *Creative expression*: Each robot became a reflection of its builder's personality, with unique decorations ranging from glasses and bow ties to colorful foam shapes.
- *Social interaction*: The shared activity naturally prompted conversation and collaboration between participants.
- *Comfort with technology*: The soft, fabric-based body of LICA — combined with its non-threatening appearance — made it approachable even for children who are typically sensitive to robotic or electronic devices.

> "The goal was never just to teach robotics — it was to create a moment where a child feels seen, heard, and connected."

### Why LICA Works for ASD Contexts

LICA's design philosophy aligns closely with therapeutic and educational principles used in autism support:

| Design Choice | Benefit for ASD |
|---|---|
| Soft fabric body | Reduces sensory anxiety compared to hard plastic robots |
| Natural wood & textile materials | Creates a warm, non-clinical aesthetic |
| Customizable appearance | Encourages personal connection and emotional investment |
| Simple, expressive gestures | Supports non-verbal communication and emotional mirroring |
| Low cost (~$200) | Enables deployment in schools and therapy centers at scale |

This session is part of a broader initiative to bring open-source social robotics into *inclusive education environments*, making LICA not just a research platform, but a genuine companion for children who experience the world differently.

LICA is a handcrafted, open-hardware social robot designed for researchers and makers. Unlike commercial social robots costing $10,000+, LICA delivers comparable gesture expressiveness and interaction capabilities at a fraction of the cost. Originally developed at Cornell University, LICA provides full access to mechanical designs, electronics schematics, and software—all under MIT license.

## Features

LICA provides a complete social robotics platform with hardware, firmware, and software components:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Mechanical Design** | Tensile soft robot with fabric-based body, 8 servo motors, laser-cut acrylic frame |
| **Motor Control** | MG996R servo motors with thermal-aware velocity control at 50Hz update rate |
| **Gesture System** | 20+ predefined gestures, sequence programming via Blockly visual editor |
| **Web Dashboard** | Real-time control interface accessible via browser at port 8000 |
| **Mobile App** | iOS/Android app for motion control using phone gyroscope |
| **Python SDK** | Full API for gesture sequencing, motor control, and sensor integration |
| **ROS Integration** | Ready-to-use ROS nodes for research integration |

### Gesture Parameter Configuration

The gesture system operates in two modes: **Idle** (low-energy background behaviors) and **Active** (full interaction mode):

| Parameter | Idle | Active | Description |
|----------|:----:|:------:|-------------|
| Neck pitch range | 15° | 45° | Vertical head movement |
| Neck yaw range | 20° | 60° | Horizontal head movement |
| Ear rotation | 10° | 35° | Side-mounted servo movement |
| Body sway amplitude | 0.05 | 0.15 | Normalized sway intensity |
| Gesture speed factor | 0.6 | 1.0 | Animation playback rate |
| Response latency target | 200ms | 80ms | Motor command response time |
| Servo torque limit | 40% | 80% | Current limiting for safety |
| Motor current limit | 300mA | 600mA | Power consumption cap |

##  Experimental Results

Our quantitative evaluation demonstrates LICA's performance across key metrics:

### Gesture Trajectory Validation

![Gesture Trajectory](figures/figure4_trajectory_fidelity.png)

**Analysis:** Commanded vs. measured joint trajectories across multi-gesture interaction sequences show servo tracking achieves **RMSE of 1.4°** with average latency of **47ms**, validated on MG996R servos at 50Hz control loop. The measured trajectory closely follows commanded paths with minimal overshoot, confirming precise motion control across nod, tilt, and look-away patterns.

### Servo Performance Analysis

![Servo Performance](figures/figure2_servo_performance.png)

**Analysis:** Thermal-aware control reduces servo temperature by 28% (52°C vs 72°C) during extended operation while maintaining tracking error below 2.5°. Current draw decreases from 480mA to 310mA—critical for battery-powered deployments. The thermal-aware strategy extends servo lifespan by an estimated 3x in continuous operation scenarios.

### Gesture Recognition Training

![Training Curves](figures/figure3_learning_curves.png)

**Analysis:** Machine learning models for gesture classification achieve **92% accuracy** after 200 training epochs. Emotion classification reaches 88%, and engagement prediction stabilizes at 65%. False positive rate drops below 4%, ensuring LICA responds only to intended gestures rather than ambient motion.

### Performance Comparison

| Metric | LICA | Blossom (baseline) | Improvement |
|--------|------|---------------------|------------|
| Motor Response Time | 47 ms | 65 ms | **27% faster** |
| Trajectory RMSE | 1.4° | 2.8° | **50% more accurate** |
| Thermal Safe Operation | 52°C max | 72°C max | **28% cooler** |
| Gesture Accuracy | 92% | 78% | **18% improvement** |
| Setup Time | 4 hours | 8 hours | **50% faster build** |
| Total Cost | ~$200 | ~$180 | Similar cost |
